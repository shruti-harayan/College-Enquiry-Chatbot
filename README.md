# 🤖 College Enquiry Chatbot

This project is a smart **College Enquiry Chatbot** built using **Google Dialogflow** and **Python Flask**. It automates answers to common student queries related to college admissions, fees, courses, facilities, and more. The chatbot can be easily integrated into a college website or used as a standalone assistant.

## 🧠 Overview

The chatbot uses **Dialogflow** to understand user queries through NLP and responds appropriately using predefined intents and training phrases. The **Flask backend** handles user requests and communicates with Dialogflow, while the **frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** provides a simple chat interface.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Component       | Technology          |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Frontend       | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Backend        | Python (Flask)      |
| NLP Engine     | Google Dialogflow   |
| Deployment     | Railway |
| API Communication  | Dialogflow <-> Flask (via HTTP requests)  |

## ✨ Features

- Automated responses to college-related queries (admissions, courses, contact info, etc.)
- Context-aware follow-up questions using Dialogflow
- Simple and clean frontend chat interface
- Easy backend integration using Flask
- Deployable on cloud platforms like Google Cloud App Engine or Railway.

---

## How It Works

1. User types a question on the chatbot interface.
2. The frontend sends the question to the Flask backend.
3. Flask sends this query to Dialogflow using its SDK.
4. Dialogflow returns a response based on the matched intent.
5. Flask sends the response back to the frontend.
6. The user sees the answer in the chatbot window.
